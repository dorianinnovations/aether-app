## 🐛 IDENTIFIED ISSUES

### Critical Issues
1. **No Posts Showing**: 
   - Root cause: No posts exist if user has no friends OR friends haven't posted
   - Solution: Create sample posts and ensure friends are added

2. **Missing Activity Types in Feed**:
   - Root cause: FeedScreen only shows 'post' type, ignores status_update, mood_update, etc.
   - Solution: Update filter to include all activity types

3. **Empty State for New Users**:
   - Root cause: No fallback content when user has no friends
   - Solution: Add onboarding prompts and suggested actions

### Minor Issues
- Loading states need improvement
- Empty state for no friends/posts
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
