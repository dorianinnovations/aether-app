### Design System
Built on atomic design principles with a comprehensive token system:
- **Atoms**: Basic UI elements (Button, Input, Icon)
- **Molecules**: Component combinations (MessageBubble, MetricCard)  
- **Organisms**: Complex UI sections (Header, TabBar)
- **Templates**: Page layouts and structures

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

AetheR features a sophisticated neumorphic design language that emphasizes:
- **Premium Typography**: Carefully selected font families (Crimson Pro, Inter, Nunito)
- **Subtle Interactions**: Haptic feedback and smooth animations
- **Adaptive Theming**: Light/dark mode with contextual color palettes
- **Glass Morphism**: Modern visual effects with depth and transparency
