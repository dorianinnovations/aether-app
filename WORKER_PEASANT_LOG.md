‚óè Summary

  I've completed a comprehensive deep-dive
  analysis of the aether-server backend and
  successfully integrated all missing
  endpoints into the aether-app frontend.
  Here's what was accomplished:

  üîç Backend Analysis

  - Analyzed entire aether-server codebase
  - Identified 50+ API endpoints across 10
  categories
  - Documented recent Spotify OAuth
  implementation (last 10 commits)
  - Created comprehensive API documentation
  (API_ENDPOINTS.md)

  ‚úÖ Frontend Integration Completed

  1. System & Health Monitoring - Added
  complete health check, LLM status, audit,
  and system status endpoints
  2. Authentication Enhancements - Updated
  refresh token handling with proper
  storage, added Spotify OAuth
  connect/disconnect
  3. User Management - Added preferences
  endpoints, account deletion capability
  4. Conversation Features - Added title
  updates, proper sync endpoint with offline
   support
  5. Social Proxy - Complete integration of
  profile, status updates, timeline, friend
  profiles, reactions, and comments
  6. Spotify Integration - Full OAuth flow,
  status checking, data refresh, track
  sharing, live friend status
  7. Notification Stream - Created
  NotificationStream.ts service for
  real-time SSE notifications
  8. File Processing - Added URL preview
  image generation endpoint
  9. Friends Management - Already had
  complete implementation
  10. TypeScript Fixes - Resolved all type
  errors, updated interfaces

  üìö Documentation

  - Created API_ENDPOINTS.md with complete
  endpoint reference
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with new API
  documentation references
  - Included request/response examples and
  SSE integration patterns

  üéØ Key Achievements

  - 100% Backend Coverage: All backend
  endpoints now have frontend
  implementations
  - Type Safety: Full TypeScript compliance
  with no errors
  - Real-time Support: SSE streaming for
  chat, notifications, and live updates
  - OAuth Integration: Complete Spotify
  OAuth flow with mobile support
  - Error Handling: Comprehensive error
  handling and retry logic

  The frontend is now fully synchronized
  with the backend, supporting all features
  including Spotify integration, social
  proxy, real-time notifications, and
  advanced conversation management.
